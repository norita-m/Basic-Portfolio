			<h2>About Me</h2>

			<img src="assets/images/sports-q-g-256-199-9.jpg" alt="Your Name" id="bio-image">

				<p>Born and bred in west Texas since 1979. Youngest of three kids born to Mexican immigrant parents. Spent a good part of my childhood playing in the dirt at my grandmother's house in Ojinaga, Chihuahua, Mexico. Band nerd, art weirdo, and French student.</p> 

				<p>Studied Communication Design at Texas Tech University. Not currently working in a creative setting, but hope to change that pretty soon. At my happiest when I'm travelling, meeting people from different backgrounds, seeing new places, or hanging out in the country with some farm animals.</p>
